- Sign_Lightdetectionfile : prediction.py    
There are two images, to show the prediction (1.jpg and 2.jpg)
As there were a lot of problems, I have calculated the slope with the assumption that the camera is placed in the center of the mobile platform. (IF you dont understand what I mean, I can explain it to you personally and show some example)
- Lanedetectionfile: color.py (Ignore Shadowremoval folder)
trackFinal() function do the detection
It doesnt return the slope yet. But can be added easily, else ask me
  negative slope = left turn, positive for right turn
